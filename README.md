# Hangman
### Written in C++

*Background: I originally created this hangman game when I first learned C++ in 2014 (it wasn't pretty). Now that I've taken C++ courses in college, I've taken that original version and revised it to properly use the C++ language and acceptable coding standards.*

## How to run:
1. Clone this reposotory locally
2. Via command line, go to the repository
3. Type `make` and hit enter
4. Type `./hangman` and hit enter
5. Enjoy the game!
